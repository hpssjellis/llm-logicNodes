OK, actually works, probably do not need the second set of links


Generate a JSON object containing a hierarchical tree of data about different types of animals. The JSON should have two top-level keys: "nodes" and "links". The "nodes" array should contain objects with "id", "parentId", "name", and a "fact" property. The "links" array should contain objects with "sourceId", "targetId", and a "joiningFact". Do not include any text outside of the JSON object.
